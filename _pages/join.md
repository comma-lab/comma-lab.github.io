We are always keen for motivated people to come and work with us.
COMMA includes researchers from many different disciplines, from engineering and mathematics to music and acoustics.
We are part of the world-leading [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) and enjoy collaborations with departments across QMUL, including [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Music Cognition](http://music-cognition.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Advanced Robotics](https://www.robotics.qmul.ac.uk/), and [Maths](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/research/statistics-and-data-science/).
[We are located](/contact/) in Mile End in East London, with excellent transport links and an active campus.

If you are interested in joining us, please reach out with a CV and short proposal. Projects should address psychologically or technologically relevant questions in communication acoustics, digital music, or [social interaction](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/research/faculties-and-research-centres/science-and-engineering/social-interaction-health-and-wellbeing/).   


<!-- #### Postdocs -->

<b><u>Postdoc</u> funding</b> sources include:

* [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)

<!-- #### PhD research -->

<b><u>PhD</u> funding</b> is available through multiple schemes. These include:

* C4DM hosts the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI and Music (AIM)](https://aim.qmul.ac.uk/), which will offer 12+ fully funded PhD studentships for September 2023 start. Application deadline is in January 2023. Available to UK residents and EU/overseas nationals.
* We support applicants funded by national schemes, e.g., [China Scholarship Council](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/scholarships/items/china-scholarship-council-scholarships.html), [CONACyT (Mexico)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/scholarships/items/conacyt-scholarships.html), [COLFUTURO (Colombia)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/scholarships/items/colfuturo-scholarships.html). More schemes are listed [on QMUL's website](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/funding_phd/studentships/). Application deadlines may vary across schemes.
* We support applicants funded by [The London Arts & Humanities Partnership (LAHP)](https://www.lahp.ac.uk/prospective-students/). 

In some occasions we accept self-funded PhD researchers.
