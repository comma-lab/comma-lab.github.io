Headed by [Dr Charalampos Saitis](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/profiles/saitischaralampos.html) the COMMA Lab is part of the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) (C4DM) at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). We conduct research into the ways people perceive sound and technologies for improving communication.

We work across disciplines of music, engineering, psychology, and cognitive science to understand and model audio communication between humans and between humans and machines.

<hr>

<!-- Our research themes include: -->

<!-- * Perception, cognition, and aesthetics of sound
* Cross-sensory perception involving sound
* Enabling digital audio systems with an understanding of how we listen
* Modelling human values (and biases) with multimodal music data
* Digital tools for education, outreach, and research  -->

<!-- * Audio/ timbre psychoacoustics and semantics
* Timbre tools for digital lutherie and interaction
* Cross-sensory perception involving sound/ timbre
* Neural audio/ timbre synthesis and processing
* Social music data science <!-- 

<!--  Founded in 2021, COMMA is led by Charalampos Saitis. Members and collaborators come from across C4DM and the Schools of EECS, SEMS, and SMS, including PhD students on the [Artificial Intelligence & Music](http://aim.qmul.ac.uk/) (UKRI AIM), [Data-informed Audience-centric Media Engineering](https://dame.qmul.ac.uk/) (QMUL-BBC DAME), and [China Scholarship Council](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/scholarships/items/china-scholarship-council-scholarships.html) (QMUL-CSC) programmes.

The lab has received funding from the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/), [SSHRC-ACTOR](https://www.actorproject.org/), and [QMUL's Centre for Public Engagement](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/publicengagement/about-engagement/centre-for-public-engagement/). -->
