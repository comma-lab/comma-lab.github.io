									<h3 id="P1">Timbre Tools for the Digital Instrument Maker</h3>
									<p>The traditional luthier will select rosewood to create a dark and complex guitar sound. The analog synth designer may choose optical components for crafting warm tones. Yet timbre — or tone, texture, sound colour — is conspicuously absent from the digital instrument maker’s toolbox.  Making digital musical instruments (DMIs)  is still based on concepts from early analog and digital synthesis, and relies on classical tools like oscilloscopes and signal generators.</p><p>We seek to shift this perspective of DMI design to a more sound-based, timbre-first practice. Timbre Tools will augment and enrich the digital luthier’s workbench. Through building instruments using flexible, open-ended tools for timbral design, amongst other tools, makers and artists can learn about sound technologies, become more aware of timbre phenomena, and craft compelling new instruments.</p>
									<h3 id="P2">Why a hackathon? Who is it for?</h3>
									<p>The Timbre Tools Hackathon aims to bring together practitioners and researchers in the fields of music technology, audio programming, deep learning, interaction and design engineering, and timbre studies (acoustics, perception, aesthetics). A hackathon is an opportunity to learn from one another, share methods and tools, explore risky ideas, foster collaboration, and innovate across disciplines and communities.</p><p>This is an interdisciplinary initiative. Participants from all stages of practice and research are welcome.</p>
									<h3 id="P3">What is a Timbre Tool?</h3>
									<p>It supports the timbral design of digital musical instruments. It is a tool for instrument makers, composers, performers (who make their own bespoke instruments), and even live coders. We are currently engaging with these communities to produce creative prompts for the hackathon.</p><p>It is not a tool for musicians (who are not makers) and audiences. We are not looking to build new instruments, but to create new tools that aid the creative process of instrument making. Although we believe all musicians and audiences will ultimately benefit from Timbre Tools!</p><p>It can encapsulate one or several notions of the timbre gestalt: tone, sonority, texture, noise, resonances, harmonics, fluctuations, modulations, spectrograms, semantics, metaphor, crossmodality, embodiment, gesture, sensing, material, "the illusory stuff of our dreams" in Schoenberg's words, you name it!</p><p>It can be designed from scratch or based on available maker tools. It can be about sensor design and fabrication, interfacing between the physical and digital worlds, or enabling expressive control at multiple levels of meaningful abstraction, amongst many other ideas that we hope to co-develop with hackathon participants.</p><p>Machine learning and AI provide interesting opportunities to interface with sound via timbre, and can be a point of entry for creating a Timbre Tool. <a href="https://rodrigoconstanzo.com/sp-tools/" target="_blank">SP-Tools</a> and the <a href="https://www.flucoma.org/" target="_blank">FluCoMa Toolkit</a> are good examples, as are approaches to <a href="https://media.vigliensoni.com/video/iccc2023" target="_blank">interactive exploration of latent space</a> in neural audio synthesis. </p>
									<h3 id="P4">Creative Prompts</h3>
									<p>We have been talking to makers, artists, live coders, exploring ways of meaningful engagement with timbre in their musical craft/making practice. These are the prompts that have emerged, and teams can use:</p>
									<p><i>deep timbre</i> – deep learning, deep listening, learning to listen<br>
									<i>to infinity and beyond</i> – explore, navigate, generate, timbre space<br>
									<i>sensing timbre</i> - sensors, materials, circuits, acoustics, embodiment<br>
									<i>timbrecheck</i> – live performance, sound recording, timbre in space<br>
									<i>back to the future</i> – analysis-by-synthesis, reflection, sound reproduction<br>
									<i>timbre for all</i> – community, social interaction, accessibility</p>
									<h3 id="P5">Details</h3>
									<p>The Timbre Tools Hackathon will take place at the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/howtofindus/mileend/index.html" target="_blank">Mile End campus</a> of Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and anywhere on earth – remote participation is possible and encouraged – in 4 phases:</p>

										<li class="icon solid fa-cubes"><h5>WORKSHOPS AND PROMPTS</h5><em><span class="date-font">2–9 PM Friday 16 February 2024</span></em><br>
											Recordings of the workshops will be streamed and shared online for those who are not able to attend.<br>
											<em><span class="date-font">2:00–3:00</span></em>&ensp;<a href="https://rodrigoconstanzo.com/sp-tools/" target="_blank">SP-Tools</a> with <a href="https://rodrigoconstanzo.com/" target="_blank">Rodrigo Constanzo</a><br>
											The workshop will focus on exploring machine learning in the context of real-time, low-latency applications. This will specifically use and explore SP-Tools, a set of machine learning tools for low-latency realtime performance. We will also talk about some broader machine learning concepts in the context of music making via the Fluid Corpus Manipulation toolbox. Some prior knowledge of machine learning is useful but not required, but some knowledge of Max will be necessary to make the most out of the workshop.<br>
											<em><span class="date-font">3:20–4:50</span></em>&ensp;<a href="https://bela.io/" target="_blank">Bela</a> with <a href="https://andrewmcpherson.org/" target="_blank">Andrew McPherson</a> and <a href="https://jordieshier.com/" target="_blank">Jordie Shier</a><br>
											This hands-on workshop introduces Bela, an embedded maker platform for responsive audio and sensor processing. Bela can be used to create digital musical instruments, synthesisers, and other interactive projects, which can be developed in C/C++, Pure Data (Pd) or Supercollider, amongst other languages. The platform features an on-board browser-based IDE and oscilloscope, a browser GUI integration customisable with p5.js, onboard examples and documentation, and online community resources. This workshop will focus on creating interactive music projects using Pd and/or C++, bridging the gap between powerful audio processing and physical computing. During this workshop, you will be guided through some simple circuit-building and programming activities, including cross-compiling and deploying a real-time deep-learning model in Bela. Bela kits, breadboards, sensors and other electronics will be provided for use during the workshop. Participants should bring their own laptop (any platform) with a working browser and a pair of headphones with an AUX connection.<br>
											<em><span class="date-font">5:10–6:40</span></em>&ensp;<a href="https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow" target="_blank">SignalFlow</a> with <a href="https://www.erase.net/" target="_blank">Daniel Jones</a><br>
											This workshop will introduce SignalFlow, a Python framework for audio signal processing and synthesis. We’ll work through a series of methods for processing, analyzing and synthesizing timbre, including waveshaping, spectral processing, and corpus-based concatenative synthesis.<br>
											<em><span class="date-font">7:00–8:10</span></em>&ensp;<a href="https://neutone.space" target="_blank">neutone.space</a> with <a href="https://github.com/christhetree">Christopher Mitcheltree</a><br>
											Neutone is a platform and community that enables musicians and creators to experiment with the latest AI technology in their favorite DAWs, while making it easy for researchers to share their AI models without having to write C++ code or learn the complexities of building realtime audio plugins. This workshop will provide an overview of the Neutone platform, taking you step by step through the simple process of building, wrapping, and exporting your own neural audio models in Python. The different Neutone plugins and how they are being used by artists today will be demonstrated along with a sneak peak of some new developments. No prior knowledge is required, although some basic understanding of Python and audio effects would be beneficial. <br>
											<em><span class="date-font">8:20–9:00</span></em>&ensp;Creative prompts!<br>
											<em><span class="date-font">9:00–...</span></em>&ensp;For those who can attend, socialising and connecting will continue in a pub nearby.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-users"><h5>BRAINSTORMING AND TEAM SIGN-UP</h5><em><span class="date-font">9 PM Friday 16 to 5 PM Friday 23 February 2024</span></em><br>A link will be posted to a shared communication board where interested individuals can post project ideas and form collaborations.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-code"><h5>HACKING</h5><em><span class="date-font">4 PM Friday 23 to 5 PM Sunday 25 February 2024</span></em><br>Following opening remarks and team sign-up completion (4–5 PM), the hacking period will run for 48 hours. Physical space and materials will be available at QMUL for those joining us in London, but teams can choose to work in any format they see fit. We encourage participants to sleep, eat, and go outside, and not spend all this time hacking.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-trophy"><h5>DEMOS, VOTING, AWARDS & PRIZES</h5><em><span class="date-font">5–8 PM Sunday 25 February 2024</span></em><br>Depending on the number of submissions received, we will aim to demo all submitted projects. In any case, a link to all submitted projects will be provided after the hackathon. Four awards, judged by a panel of experts and accompanied by prizes courtesy of our sponsors, will celebrate the most innovative ideas and teamwork: Best Idea/Research Direction, Best Presentation/Demo, Best Creative Hack, and Best Responsible Hack.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>We have started putting together <a href="https://github.com/comma-lab/timbre-resources" target="_blank">a living document of resources for working with and designing timbre</a>. Closer to the Hackathon we will publish a list of physical materials for instrument making that we can provide to teams.</p>
