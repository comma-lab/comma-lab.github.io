Vjosa together with DAME/C4DM student Iacopo Ghinassi have developed [a new web app that automatically predicts moral values in text and music lyrics](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vjosap/MoralBERTApp). Users can upload CSV or Excel files containing text or lyrics, and the app will assign probabilities for 10 moral categories. For more details on the related research, check our recent [GoodIT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3677525.3678694) and [ISMIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18787) papers.
