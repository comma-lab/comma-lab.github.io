Two papers on synthesiser inversion and sound matching accepted at ISMIR 2025! [Ben](https://benhayes.net/)'s paper proposes [relaxed equivariant flow matching to adaptively discover symmetries in synthesiser parameter space from data](https://benhayes.net/synth-perm/). [Haokun](https://github.com/tiianhk)'s paper proposes a novel sound matching model trained in the context of timbre (dis)similarity. See you in Daejeon, Korea!
