Two papers on synthesiser inversion and sound matching accepted at ISMIR 2025! [Ben](https://benhayes.net/)'s paper proposes [relaxed equivariant flow matching to adaptively discover symmetries in synthesiser parameter space from data](https://benhayes.net/synth-perm/). [Haokun](https://tiianhk.github.io)'s paper proposes extracting style embeddings from a sound matching model to capture perceptual timbre similarity. See you in Daejeon, Korea!
