New papers on [MoralBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07678), [controllable music generation with diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14044), and our [Timbre Tools Hackathon](https://comma.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/timbre-tools-hackathon/) accepted at ACM GoodIT, IEEE MLSP, and ACM Audio Mostly, respectively. We look forward to sharing our research with these communities!
